    "The goal of this notebook is to show the performance of [`merfish3d-analysis`](https://github.com/QI2lab/merfish3d-analysis) on simulated MERFISH data. The output metric is the [F1-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score) that determines how well `merfish3d-analysis` recovers the ground truth location and identity of the RNA molecules used to generate the simulation. We will use a single FOV with uniformly distributed RNA molecules. **Note:** `merfish3d-analysis` requires a GPU runtime and will not run without one."

    "Roughly 1200 individual RNA molecules that are randomly distributed in space within a 41.6 𝜇m by 41.6 𝜇m by 15.0 𝜇m volume (x,y,z). The individual RNA molecules are imaged using a 16-bit Hamming Weight 4 Distance 4 codebook and a simulated microscope with realistic parameters and noise. The imaging simulation is performed in 8 rounds each with 3 channels, containing 2 MERFISH bits per round and a fidicual marker. Three simulations of the same RNA molecules are performed for three different axial steps sizes (0.315 𝜇m, 1.0 𝜇m, 1.5 𝜇m) to explore the impact of sufficient axial sampling when imaging."
